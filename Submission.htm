    Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most subversive science and technology, which has strong processing ability in computational intelligence, cognitive intelligence and cognitive intelligence. At present, the development of AI has entered a new stage, opening a new direction to overcome the drawbacks of traditional solutions for many problems.<br>
    With the integration of intermittent renewable energy and large-scale regional interconnection of energy systems, sustainable energy and electric systems have evolved into highly dimensional dynamic large-scale systems. Moreover, the randomness of users’ energy consumption behaviors and the flexible use of active loads also increase the complexity and uncertainty of energy systems. The sustainable energy and electric systems are in real-time dynamic change, and the research of related problems is nonlinear and uncertain. AI is the core support technology of intelligent energy. It has strong optimization processing ability and strong learning ability to deal with high-dimensional and nonlinear problems, which will effectively solve various challenges faced by the sustainable energy and electric systems.<br>
    Potential topics of this session include but are not limited to the following:<br>
    •	Novel theories, concepts, and paradigms of the convergence of AI<br>
    •	Data-driven decision making in sustainable energy and electric systems <br>
    •	Data-driven analysis and optimization of energy consumption side<br>
    •	Data-driven control of new power system<br>
    •	Data-driven situational awareness of new power system<br>
    •	Data-driven fault diagnosis and status monitoring of power equipment<br>

<h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
<p class="STYLE2">
    Optimization problems are widespread in many real-world fields, including science, engineering, and technology. Despite the many studies on optimization, most current optimization techniques rely on a traditional centralized model. However, with the increasing storage capacity and computational power of edge devices in modern distributed networks, there has been an emergence of decentralized computing such as federated optimization. This novel approach enables optimization to be executed locally at edge devices with minimal communication between them. While this method has great potential, it also presents new challenges and privacy concerns given the large amount of data collected by edge devices.<br>
In addition to standard optimization considerations like maximizing performance, users in some scenarios also care about fairness in decision-making, multi-objective preference or model construction. Thus, developing new algorithmic ideas is paramount for optimizing both overall performance and considerations related to fairness.<br>
Given these considerations, there is currently increased attention to developing secure and privacy-preserving optimization techniques that are also fair-aware. Some of the research topics include security and robustness, privacy-preservation, fairness, verifiability, and transparency when designing optimization algorithms. Notably, significant issues remain unresolved in this field.<br>
It is important to discuss the definitions of security, privacy and fairness concerning optimization since many researchers understand these concepts differently. Finding an appropriate balance between performance optimization alongside privacy/fairness/security guarantees represents another challenge. Additionally, long-standing factors that affect distributed and federated machine learning methods need reevaluation within the context of optimization including non-IID data and enhancing communication efficiency.<br>
Therefore, designing new benchmark problems and performance indicators for evaluating secure, privacy-preserving and fair-aware optimization methods remains key towards addressing open questions on this subject matter.<br>
The aim of this special session is to bring together researchers from different application fields working on optimization and present new solutions to the above-discussed challenges. The special session will focus on new advances, review and discuss the state-of-the-art in the theory, algorithm design, and applications of using secure, privacy-preserving, and fairness-aware solutions in optimization.<br>
Authors are invited to submit papers on one or more of the following topics:<br>
•	Privacy-preserving Bayesian optimization<br>
•	Privacy-preserving evolutionary algorithm<br>
•	Privacy-preserving distributed optimization<br>
•	Secure federated data-driven optimization<br>
•	Federated surrogate models<br>
•	Fairness-aware acquisition function<br>
•	Attacks and defenses in optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware multi-objective optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware data-driven optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware federated optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware multi-objective machine learning<br>
•	Benchmark problems for secure, privacy-preserving and fairness-aware optimization<br>
•	Performance indicators for secure, privacy-preserving and fairness-aware optimization<br>
