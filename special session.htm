<h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
<p class="STYLE2">
    Optimization problems are widespread in many real-world fields, including science, engineering, and technology. Despite the many studies on optimization, most current optimization techniques rely on a traditional centralized model. However, with the increasing storage capacity and computational power of edge devices in modern distributed networks, there has been an emergence of decentralized computing such as federated optimization. This novel approach enables optimization to be executed locally at edge devices with minimal communication between them. While this method has great potential, it also presents new challenges and privacy concerns given the large amount of data collected by edge devices.<br>
In addition to standard optimization considerations like maximizing performance, users in some scenarios also care about fairness in decision-making, multi-objective preference or model construction. Thus, developing new algorithmic ideas is paramount for optimizing both overall performance and considerations related to fairness.<br>
Given these considerations, there is currently increased attention to developing secure and privacy-preserving optimization techniques that are also fair-aware. Some of the research topics include security and robustness, privacy-preservation, fairness, verifiability, and transparency when designing optimization algorithms. Notably, significant issues remain unresolved in this field.<br>
It is important to discuss the definitions of security, privacy and fairness concerning optimization since many researchers understand these concepts differently. Finding an appropriate balance between performance optimization alongside privacy/fairness/security guarantees represents another challenge. Additionally, long-standing factors that affect distributed and federated machine learning methods need reevaluation within the context of optimization including non-IID data and enhancing communication efficiency.<br>
Therefore, designing new benchmark problems and performance indicators for evaluating secure, privacy-preserving and fair-aware optimization methods remains key towards addressing open questions on this subject matter.<br>
The aim of this special session is to bring together researchers from different application fields working on optimization and present new solutions to the above-discussed challenges. The special session will focus on new advances, review and discuss the state-of-the-art in the theory, algorithm design, and applications of using secure, privacy-preserving, and fairness-aware solutions in optimization.<br>
Authors are invited to submit papers on one or more of the following topics:<br>
•	Privacy-preserving Bayesian optimization<br>
•	Privacy-preserving evolutionary algorithm<br>
•	Privacy-preserving distributed optimization<br>
•	Secure federated data-driven optimization<br>
•	Federated surrogate models<br>
•	Fairness-aware acquisition function<br>
•	Attacks and defenses in optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware multi-objective optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware data-driven optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware federated optimization<br>
•	Fairness-aware multi-objective machine learning<br>
•	Benchmark problems for secure, privacy-preserving and fairness-aware optimization<br>
•	Performance indicators for secure, privacy-preserving and fairness-aware optimization<br>

<h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
<p class="STYLE2">
    Meta-heuristic algorithms, including evolutionary algorithms and swarm optimization, face challenges when solving time-consuming problems, as typically these approaches require thousands of function evaluations to arrive at solutions that are of reasonable quality. Surrogate models, which are computationally cheap, have in recent years gained in popularity in assisting meta-heuristic optimization, by replacing the compute-expense/time-expensive problem during phases of the heuristic search. However, due to the curse of dimensionality, it is very difficult, if not impossible to train accurate surrogate models. Thus, appropriate model management techniques, memetic strategies and other schemes are often indispensable. In addition, modern data analytics involving advance sampling techniques and learning techniques such as semi-supervised learning, transfer learning and active learning are highly beneficial for speeding up evolutionary search while bringing new insights into the problems of interest. This special session aims at bringing together researchers from both academia and industry to explore future directions in this field.<br>
    The topics of this special session include but are not limited to the following topics:<br>
    •	Surrogate-assisted evolutionary optimization for computationally expensive problems<br>
    •	Adaptive sampling using machine learning and statistical techniques<br>
    •	Surrogate model management in evolutionary optimization<br>
    •	Data-driven optimization using big data and data analytics<br>
    •	Knowledge acquisition from data and reuse for evolutionary optimization<br>
    •	Computationally efficient evolutionary algorithms for large scale and/or many-objective optimization problems<br>
    •	Federated data-driven optimization<br>
    •	Real world applications including multidisciplinary optimization<br>

<h2>Aim and Scope</h2>
<p class="STYLE2">
    The volume of data collected in manufacturing is growing. Big data offers a tremendous opportunity in the transformation of today's manufacturing paradigm to smart manufacturing. Smart manufacturing aims to convert data acquired across the product lifecycle into manufacturing intelligence in order to yield positive impacts on all aspects of manufacturing. Data-driven intelligence and services use artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to analyze and transform massive data into intelligent data insights, which can then be used to improve services and decision making. <br>
    Despite data-driven intelligence and services have attracted a lot of attention in intelligent manufacturing, researchers still have many challenges to explore. For example, many problems in machine design lack explicit optimization objectives or are computationally expensive in objective evaluation, resulting in difficulty of achieving a good design. Machine learning approaches have been applied to assist in optimization, which is called data-driven optimization. Model management techniques still play a significantly important role in data-driven optimization. In addition, securing big data techniques, such as secure computations, validation of inputs from endpoints, and privacy-preserving data analytics, plays a significantly important role in guarding both the data and analytics processes against attacks, theft, or other malicious activities that could harm or negatively affect them. Furthermore, data-driven decision making is beneficial to mitigate bias in decisions, avoid fault diagnosis and operation, improve services, and reduce expenses. Finally, the application problems for verifying the efficiency and effectiveness of different approaches are also indispensable.<br>
    This special session aims to promote research on data-driven intelligence and services for smart manufacturing.<br>
    The topics of this special session include but are not limited to the following topics:<br>
    •	Data-driven computational intelligence for smart manufacturing<br>
    •	Big data analytics in product lifecycle <br>
    •	Data mining in manufacturing<br>
    •	Deep learning services in the product lifecycle<br>
    •	Reliable federated learning on manufacturing data<br>
    •	Intelligent scheduling in manufacturing<br>
    •	Block chain <br>
    •	Data-driven industrial diagnosis <br>
    •	Data-driven industrial forecasting<br>
    •	Data-driven decision making for smart manufacturing<br>
